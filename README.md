## Lessons Learned

Reflecting on my lessons learned, I realize this project gave me experience in multiple aspects of
software development. I have broken them down into sections to reflect on them more coherently.

### Time to market

My biggest frustration with this project was getting it to market in time. During the days when I
was interested in this project, Wordle and its derivatives were extremely popular. When I conceived
of this project, there were many sports themed wordle derivatives, but none for American Football.
One example is Poeltl, which was an extremely popular one themed after American Basketball. My
friends one day jokingly suggested I make one for the NFL, and that night I immediately started
working on it. I started working with React Native, but my lack of experience with javascript made
it really difficult for me to get far. This wasted lots of time for me, and I was forced to switch
to Flutter which seemed easier to work with. Somewhere around that time Weddle was released. Weddle
beat me to the market and gained popularity immediately. Many news articles were written about it,
which was demotivating and I lost enthusiasm for the project. I took a break and completed it a few
weeks later. I am glad that I completed this project, and I learned a lot about the importance of
time to market.

### Programming & Web development I developed new skills in web

development and programming. I learned how to handle asynchronous functions and promises better. I
learned a lot about react, although I eventually stopped using it and switched to Flutter. I gained
lots of experience with Google Firebase as well. I realized that Google Firebase is a simpler
version of some AWS services. Source Code The project was written mostly with dart Flutter and some
javascript. The techstack used is called FlutterFire which is a combination of Flutter for the front
end and Google Firebase for the backend. The source code is available
at https://github.com/mmsoby/Burrdle.
